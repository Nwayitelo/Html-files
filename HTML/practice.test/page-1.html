<h1><b> A Tale of Two Citites</b> </h1>



<p>it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of<br>
 foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of <br>
 Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.<br>
 

We had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, <br>
we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period,<br>
 that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the <br>
 superlative degree of comparison only.</p>

 <p>There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; <br>
 there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both<br>

 that things in general were settled for ever.</p>

<p>All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year <br>
 one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and <br>
 the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and<br>
 the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.</p>

 <p>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound <br>
 secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night,<br>
 that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in<br>
 every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of<br>
 thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!</p>
