<h1>BAT <br>Chocolates</h1>

<p> WE TRANSFORM ETHICALLY-SOURCED <br>
ORGANICALLY-GROWN, HIGH-QUALITY COCOA<br>
 BEANS INTO DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE. </p>
 
 <h2>O'Payo</h2>

<p> Ethically-sourced cocoa beans supplied by Ingemann Fine Cocoa. Based in Tipitapa,<br>
 Nicaragua, Ingemann currently receives wet beans from 450 small holders. These <br>
 farmers receive a premium of 25% on their wet beans (compared to market rate for <br>
 dried beans) as well as cultivation support and collection at farm gate.</p>
 
 <p>Ingredients: Organic cocoa beans and organic sugar.</p>

<h3>Nahua</h3>

<p>Nahua is Costa Rica's leading fine flavour cocoa producer with a social mission <br>
committed to improving the lives of the local smallholder farmers. Like our other <br>
 cocoa bean suppliers, Nuhua collects wet beans at the farm gate and ferments them <br>
 centrally. This takes the burden of mastering the complex fermentation process off <br>
 the farmer and ensures the cocoa beans are fermented and dried to an exacting standard.</p>
