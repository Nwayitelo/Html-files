<h1> purpule Rain</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Purple Rain is a song by American musician Prince and his backing band The <br>

<h3>ORIGINS</h3>

<p>Originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration with Stevie<br>
 Nicks, Prince explained the meaning of the song as follows: "When there's blood in <br>
 the sky... red and blue = purple. Purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being<br>
 with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain."</p>
 
 <h4>RECORDING</h4>
 
 <p>The song was recorded during a benefit concert for the Minnesota Dance Theatre at<br>
 the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis on August 3, 1983. City Pages described <br>
 the 70-minute performance as Prince's "sweatiest and most soulful hometown<br>
 concert yet."</p>
 
 <h5>RECEPTION AND LEGACY </h5>
 
<P>The song ranked number 144 on the Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest Songs of<br>
 All Time. Q magazine placed it at number 40 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar <br> 
 Tracks, and Pitchfork named it the best song of the 1980s. The song is also included<br>
